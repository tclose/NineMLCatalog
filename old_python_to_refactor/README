Old Python Models to Refactor
-----------------------------

This directory contains example models in very old nineml-python prototype code.
They have not been tested for correct dynamics (at least not by me) and will
not work with any of the released nineml-python code, so will need to be
refactored before they can be used. However, they are included here for
future reference just in case they prove useful in the design of new versions
of these models.
